# Bye-Bye-Octothorpe
We all hate how inconvenient the octothorpe (#) is in python, where you regularly have to reach all the way across your keyboard just to write a comment. This python code changes that! Utilising a system of reading through every line and checking for instances of a #, then replacing it with the highly superior two slashes, you can quickly edit through python files. Sadly, in Python, the `//` symbol is used for integer division, and it does not represent a comment. Therefore, changing the comments from `#` to `//` would actually break the code. However it's just a quick experiment I coded. Also, you can do this with any file (not just python files) and replace any instances of a certain character via modifying the code slightly. Woah, that's a mouthfull!
